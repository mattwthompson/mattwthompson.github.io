Abstract: Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are a class of organic salts that are liquid at room temperature. Their physiochemical properties, including low vapor pressure and wide electrochemical stability window, have driven their use as electrolytes in many electrochemical applications, however, their slow transport properties can hinder their performance. This issue is often mitigated by solvating ionic liquids in neutral organic solvents. To date, however, solvent interactions have only been explored for a small number of solvents, particularly acetonitrile and propylene carbonate, at only a few compositions. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations in the context of a computational screening approach to study mixtures of ionic liquids in many different solvents at a range of concentrations. Building on prior work, we again find that ionic liquid diffusivity increases monotonically with greater solvent concentration. In contrast to a prior conclusion, we find that pure solvent diffusivity, not ...
