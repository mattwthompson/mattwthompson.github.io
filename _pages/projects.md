## Projects I have maintained and/or led development of
* [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) - A flexible, hierarchical
  molecule builder written in Python.

* [foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer) - A package for atom-typing force fields, parametrizing molecular simulations, and disseminating force fields.

* [pairing](https://github.com/mattwthompson/pairing) - An analysis tool that finds and analyzes molecular pairs and clusters over the course of a trajectory.

* [scattering](https://github.com/mattwthompson/scattering) - A Python package including a set of functions that generate neutron/X-Ray scattering-style data from molecular simulation trajectories.

## Other projects I have contributed to

* A handful of `mBuild` recipes: [Pore-Builder](https://github.com/rmatsum836/Pore-Builder), [dropletbuilder](https://github.com/ftiet/droplet-builder/tree/master/dropletbuilder), and [Nanotube-Builder](https://github.com/Gawquon/Nanotube-Builder)

* [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj) - A powerful Python library for analyzing trajectories, particularly things that rely on distance calculations (RMSD, RDFs, etc.). Development has slowed in the past few years.

* [ParmEd](https://github.com/parmed/parmed) - A Python tool that converts chemical topologies across formats with excellent support for file formats used by `GROMACS`, `OpenMM`, `CHARMM`, and `AMBER`.

* [MDanalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis) - A Python package for analyzing trajectories, much like `MDTraj` but with a larger and more active community in recent years.

* [signac-flow](https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-flow) - A part of the (https://signac.io/) framework, which elegantly manages large and heterogeneous data spaces, this `signac-flow` handles interactions with supercomputing clusters.
