Welcome to Matt Thompson's website!

I am a PhD Candidate in the Peter T. Cummings lab in the Department of Chemical
and Biomolecular Engineering at Vanderbilt University. My research focuses on
the use of molecular simulation to study the fundamental properties of
components of next-generation energy storage devices. Lately I have also worked
on tools that automate workflows aimed at these and other scientific questions.

In my free time I enjoy playing various games, lately this has included chess and Pokemon Go.
