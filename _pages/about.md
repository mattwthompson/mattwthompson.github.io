I am a Senior Research Software Engineer with the <a href="https://openforcefield.org">Open Force Field initiative</a>,
where I started in March 2020 (and until March 2022 held the title of Software Scientist). Broadly, I work on productionalizing research software as part of developing and maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/openforcefield">OpenFF software stack</a>.
that enables them.

Previously, I was a PhD candidate and research engineer in the Peter T.
Cummings lab in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular
Engineering at Vanderbilt University, where I received my PhD in 2019. My research there focused on the
use of molecular simulation to study the fundamental properties of components of next-generation
energy storage devices. Late in my time at Vanderbilt, I also worked on tools that automate workflows aimed at these
and other scientific questions. My main two projects at Vanderbilt were the <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/sci/first/">FIRST Center</a> and <a href="https://mosdef.org">MoSDeF</a>.

In my free time I enjoy gaming, cooking, and reading, running, and biking.
